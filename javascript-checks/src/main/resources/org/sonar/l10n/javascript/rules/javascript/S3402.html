<p>Use a <code>+</code> with two numbers and you'll get addition. But use it with a string and anything else, and you'll get concatenation. Very often that's not what's intended, and even when it is, it's likely to confuse future maintainers. </p>
<p>Since this may not be what's intended, this rule raises an issue when <code>+</code> is used with a string and a non-string.</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
var a = '42';
var b = 5;
var sum = a + b;          // Noncompliant; yields string "425"

var foo = ' is a lucky number';
alert(42 + foo);          // Noncompliant; make your intention explicit
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
var a = '42';
var b = 5;
var sum = parseInt(a) + b; // Compliant; yields 47

var foo = ' is a lucky number';
alert('' + 42 + foo);     // Use an empty string literal
alert(`${42}${foo}`);     // Use template strings; available since ES2015
</pre>
