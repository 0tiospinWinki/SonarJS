<p>
Restricting the number of <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements in loops is 
done in the interest of good structured programming. One <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code>
statement is acceptable in a loop since this allows optimal coding. However, in most cases, they
can be replaced by standard logical structures that are far more readable and understandable.

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates this rule:
</p>

<pre>
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) { // Compliant
  if (i % n == 0) {
    break;
  }
}

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) { // Non-Compliant
  if (i%n == 0) {
    break;
  }
  if (n%i == 0) {
    continue;
  }
}
</pre>
