<p>
The object of the with can have properties that collide with local variables, it can drastically change the meaning of your program :
</p>

<pre>
with (foo) {
  var x = 3;
  return x;
}
</pre>

<p>
The local variable x could be clobbered by a property of foo and perhaps it even has a setter, in which case assigning 3 could cause lots of other code to execute.
</p>

<p>
Never use the with statement.
